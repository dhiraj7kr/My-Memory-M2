## we can build M2 using open-source tools** — at least a solid MVP (Minimum Viable Product). While some limitations exist (e.g. API rate limits, model quality), there are great open-source alternatives that can handle **recording, transcription, summarization, and search**.

---

## ✅ **Open-Source Stack for M2 (My Memory)**

Here’s how to build M2 **with no cost or open-source components**:

---

### 🔉 1. **Audio Recording**

* **Mobile app**: Use native Android/iOS capabilities (React Native/Flutter both support audio recording).
* **Web app**: Use the `MediaRecorder` API to record from the browser.

  * Free and fully browser-native.

---

### ✍️ 2. **Speech-to-Text Transcription**

* ✅ **OpenAI Whisper** *(free & open source)*:

  * GitHub: [https://github.com/openai/whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
  * Run locally or on a server with a GPU (or even on CPU for small loads).
  * Very accurate and completely free.

  **Alternative** (lightweight):

  * [`whisper.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) – runs Whisper on CPU (compiled C++ version).
  * Ideal for mobile/offline use.

---

### 🧠 3. **Summarization**

* ✅ **Local LLMs using Ollama**:

  * Run small models locally (like `mistral`, `llama2`, or `phi`) with [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com).
  * Example prompt: “Summarize this conversation: {transcript}”

  **Or use Hugging Face Transformers**:

  * Use models like `facebook/bart-large-cnn` or `google/pegasus` for summarization.
  * Free to run locally with Python.

---

### 🔍 4. **Search & Memory Recall**

* ✅ **Embeddings + Vector Search**:

  * Use `sentence-transformers` (e.g. `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for embeddings – open-source and accurate.
  * Store vectors in:

    * **FAISS** (Facebook’s open-source vector DB) – super fast.
    * Or even just a local SQLite DB with simple similarity search for MVP.

---

### 💾 5. **Storage**

* **Transcripts & Metadata**: Store in SQLite or PostgreSQL (both free).
* **Audio Files**: Save locally or on a free cloud storage (e.g. Supabase, IPFS).

---

### 🌐 6. **User Interface**

* **Frontend**:

  * Web: React.js or Next.js
  * Mobile: Flutter or React Native

* **Backend**:

  * Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Node.js
  * All open-source and free.

## 🧪 MVP Workflow 

1. **Record Audio** → MediaRecorder API or React Native
2. **Transcribe** → Whisper or whisper.cpp
3. **Summarize** → Pegasus or BART (via Hugging Face Transformers)
4. **Embed** → SentenceTransformers
5. **Search** → FAISS + cosine similarity
6. **Display** → Timeline view in a web or mobile app
